# House Price Prediction

I am using miniforge3 with Python 3.8 on Ubuntu 20.04.3 lts but should work on any OS or arch.

## Installing Anaconda/Conda


### Windows

**Anaconda**

To install Anaconda on Windows download the installer from here -> [Anaconda Download](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Windows-x86_64.exe)


**Miniconda**

To install Miniconda which doesnt have the included packages of Anaconda, and instead just has the ability to create conda environments, and install conda packages. 
I've listed the different python versions below.

- [Python 3.9](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_4.10.3-Windows-x86_64.exe)

- [Python 3.8](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py38_4.10.3-Windows-x86_64.exe)

- [Python 3.7](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Windows-x86_64.exe)


**Miniforge**

Miniforge is a community driven version of conda, while miniconda is company driven by Anaconda. 
You can download the installer for Windows below.

## macOS


**Anaconda**

Anaconda doesn't have support for M1 Macbooks so I have put the Intel cpu versions below.

- [Graphical Installer](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)

- [Command Line Installer](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-MacOSX-x86_64.sh)


**Miniconda** 

Miniconda also does not have support for M1 Macbooks yet either, so I have put both graphical and command line installers for each python version below.
